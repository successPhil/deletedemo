# Instructions

Whether you follow along in class with the lecture or you tackle this on your own time, you will want to be mindful of which `branch` you have checked out.

## Branches Overview

### Main -- Initial Starting Point for Class/Lecture
**Description**:
- This branch contains a simple GraphQL Django/React project to demonstrate using GraphQL in an application.
- Simple demonstration to quickly cover all of the learning objectives.
- Instructions on how to build the code from scratch are in the respective `frontend/README.md` or `backend/README.md`.

**Tasks**:
- Clone and run the React/Django project.
- Make sure to `makemigrations`, `migrate`, and `loaddata` (movies) before running your backend server.
- Run the backend code and visit `http://localhost:8000/graphql/`.
- Interact with the built-in tool provided for documenting and interacting with our root schema.
- Run the frontend code and see if you are able to view the data from your backend API.
- Examine the changes needed to implement GraphQL in React with Apollo Client.

**Bonus**:
- Obtain some data and load it into your PostgreSQL DB. Can you create another query?

**Dependencies** (in case `requirements.txt` is missing or incomplete):

# Intro to GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language for your API and a server-side runtime for executing queries using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isnâ€™t tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.

In practice, both GraphQL and REST send HTTP requests and receive HTTP responses.

GraphQL was created by Meta (formerly Facebook) to address problems they faced with the standard REST protocol.

You can think of some familiar features from Facebook (e.g., Likes). GraphQL's main purpose is to navigate a relational network (to query a relational graph).

## Key Concepts
GraphQL Basics: Explain that GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need.

Comparison with REST: Highlight differences such as fetching multiple resources in a single request, reduced over-fetching/under-fetching, and more structured queries.

## Understanding the Schema

Your schema will primarily consist of TypeDefs, Resolvers, and Query and Mutation Types.

- **Type Definitions (TypeDefs)**
Purpose: TypeDefs define the structure of your data and the types of operations (queries/mutations) that can be performed.
Description: They describe what the data looks like, including the types and fields available in your API.


Note this is a example of what a TypeDef can look like, with graphene and django we will not write TypeDefs

Graphene and Django handle creating our necessary TypeDefs based off the models we define in our `schema.py`
```
type Pokemon {
        id: Int!
        name: String!
        types: String!
        front_default: String!
        back_default: String!
        front_shiny: String!
        back_shiny: String!
    }
```

- **Resolvers**
Purpose: Resolvers provide the logic to fetch the data for the queries and mutations defined in the TypeDefs.
Description: Resolvers are functions that handle the operations specified in the TypeDefs. They resolve the data by fetching it from a database, an external API, or other sources.
<details>
<summary>See Example</summary>

```
import graphene
from graphene_django import DjangoObjectType

from movies.models import Movies

class MoviesType(DjangoObjectType):
    class Meta:
        model = Movies
        fields = '__all__'

class Query(graphene.ObjectType):
    all_movies = graphene.List(MoviesType)
    
    def resolve_all_movies(root, info):
        return Movies.objects.all()
    

schema = graphene.Schema(query=Query)

```

Our resolver is defined as a method in our root Query class. We can use resolvers to perform operations on the data that is queried

*Note* `all_movies` defines our Query which returns a List of MoviesType
The resolver defined as a method MUST be named `resolve_all_movies`

</details>

- **Query (Read)**: A request to fetch data. It is analogous to a GET request in REST.
- **Mutation (Write)**: A request to modify data. It is analogous to POST, PUT, DELETE requests in REST.


### GraphQL vs. REST
[A blog about REST vs GraphQL](https://www.cosmicjs.com/blog/graphql-vs-rest-a-quick-guide)

**REST (Representational State Transfer)**:
- Centers around resources, each identified by a URL.
- Well-suited for traditional table-based DB setups.
- Typically have many endpoints for resources.

**GraphQL (Graph Query Language)**:
- Schema-first design, with resources described in the schema.
- Allows specifying not only the resources but also which fields are needed.
- Creates a single endpoint for all queries.
- Default queries document available fields and queries.
- Strong typing.

### Benefits of REST
- No need for special libraries to consume someone else's API.
- Requests can easily be sent through common tools like `curl`, web browsers, Postman.

### Drawbacks of GraphQL
- Requires more tooling and support on both client and server sides.
- Generally not worth the investment for simple CRUD APIs.
- More difficult to cache and optimize.
- N + 1 problem: Related to letting the client decide what data they would like to request.

<details>
  <summary>See More about caching / optimization</summary>
  REST uses HTTP GET for fetching resources, and HTTP GET has a well-defined caching behavior.
  GraphQL has a `single point` of entry and uses `HTTP POST` by default.
  * This does not mean GraphQL cannot be used to properly cache data; it may require additional tools or be more complex in nature.*
</details>

## What is GraphQL?

GraphQL allows clients to request exactly the data they need, avoiding over-fetching and under-fetching common in REST APIs. It uses a single endpoint, and a strongly typed schema defines the capabilities of the API.

### GraphQL Terminology

- **Schema**: Defines the structure of the data and the types of queries and mutations that can be performed. It acts as a blueprint for the API.
- **Type Definitions (TypeDefs)**: Define the shape of the data in the schema using the Schema Definition Language (SDL).
- **Resolvers**: Functions that handle the logic for fetching the data for each field in the schema.
- **Queries**: Used to fetch data from the GraphQL server.
- **Mutations**: Used to modify data on the server, such as creating, updating, or deleting records.

### Example Type Definition

```graphql
type Movie {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  year: Int!
  rating: String!
}
```
