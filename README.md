# Intro to GraphQL

This README will contain information and references about graphQL:

- What is graphQL
    - graph, schema, typeDefs, Resolvers, Mutations
    - What is the difference between REST and graphQL
    - What are the pros and cons of graphQL
    - Links to documentation for graphQL

# Creating a Movie application that uses graphQL

The code in this repo should be complete and working. This should allow you to clone down the repo, and run the application.

However, for learning purposes, you will probably gain the most from going through the steps to implement a graphQL API in Django, and consume it in React.



The `backend/` and `frontend/` directories each have a README with instructions on how to set up graphQL for the respective project.

If you are able to go through all of the steps and successfully get your application working, then you likely can implement a graphQL of your own, in a different project, with your own data.
